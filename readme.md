## ECDSA Node

This project is an example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses. Since there is just a single server on the back-end handling transfers, this is clearly very centralized. We won't worry about distributed consensus for this project.

However, something that we would like to incoporate is Public Key Cryptography. By using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures we can make it so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the associated address.

### Client

In my Transfer.jsx I implmented signing a transaction and recovering the public key from it. Sending this public key to my API.

### Server

In my Index.js I checked if the entered Public Key matches with the recovered Public Key from my Signature. So no one can send founds if they dont have the right private key to the entered public key.

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically! 

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.
